# Data-Platform-Services
1. Overview of Data Quality and Validation Service
The Data Quality (DQ) and Validation Service ensures the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of data before it is processed or moved to the next stage in the data pipeline. This service will be automated using Airflow and integrated with Spark for performance scalability.

Key Objectives:

Data Integrity: Ensure data complies with business rules and meets quality standards.
Automated Validation: Execute quality checks automatically at different stages of the data pipeline.
Error Reporting: Provide detailed reports on data quality failures with error logs for remediation.
Scalability: Handle large data volumes and support batch, micro-batch, and streaming data validation.
Real-time Monitoring: Ensure timely identification of data quality issues.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1. Pre-Ingestion Quality Checks

Schema validation (data type, length, and mandatory fields).
Duplication checks (check for duplicate records).
Reference data validation (checking for valid lookup values).
Null value checks for non-nullable fields.
2.2. Post-Ingestion Quality Checks

Data format validation (ensure correct file format - e.g., Parquet/CSV).
Consistency checks (e.g., foreign key relationships, range values).
Business rule validation (e.g., price must be positive, date should be in a valid range).
Record count validation between ingestion source and data platform.
2.3. Data Profiling

Generate statistics such as max, min, average, and record count.
Provide insight into distributions, cardinality, and anomalies.
2.4. Error Logging & Notification

Log errors to a centralized system (e.g., AWS CloudWatch or ELK Stack).
Generate detailed error reports with error type, failing record details, and recommended remediation.
Send alerts to defined stakeholders when data quality rules fail (using Slack, email, etc.).
2.5. Retrying Failed Data Loads

Automatic retry mechanism in case of transient issues.
Manual retry capability after data issues are fixed.
3. Technical Design
3.1. Architecture

Apache Airflow: Orchestrating the quality checks in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
Each DAG will consist of different steps (e.g., schema validation, business rule checks).
DAGs should be configurable and reusable across different pipelines.
Apache Spark: Data processing engine for performing scalable data quality checks.
Use Spark DataFrames for data validation.
Distributed execution across multiple nodes for handling large datasets.
S3: Store the raw data, logs, and quality check reports.
Ranger: Define access control policies, ensuring only authorized users can modify or view data validation reports.
3.2. Data Quality Rule Configuration

Configuration Table (stored in a database or as JSON files in S3):

Rule_ID	Rule_Description	Rule_Type	Check_Level	Error_Handling	Alert_Level	Active
001	Check for null values in column A	Pre-Ingestion	Table	Log/Alert	High	True
002	Foreign key relationship check	Post-Ingestion	Table	Abort Job	Medium	True
003	Ensure date is within the range	Post-Ingestion	Field	Skip	Low	True
004	Price should be a positive value	Post-Ingestion	Field	Abort Job	High	True
Rule_Type: Pre-ingestion or post-ingestion.
Check_Level: Field or table-level validation.
Error_Handling: What happens when validation fails (abort the job, log error, or alert users).
Alert_Level: Determines the priority of alerts (high, medium, low).
3.3. Data Quality Check Pipeline (Airflow DAG)

3.3.1. Airflow DAG Example
python
Copy code
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def validate_schema():
    # Implement schema validation logic
    pass

def validate_business_rules():
    # Implement business rule checks
    pass

def log_errors():
    # Logic to log errors and raise alerts
    pass

with DAG(dag_id='data_quality_validation', start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@daily') as dag:
    
    schema_validation = PythonOperator(
        task_id='schema_validation',
        python_callable=validate_schema
    )

    business_rule_check = PythonOperator(
        task_id='business_rule_check',
        python_callable=validate_business_rules
    )

    log_errors_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='log_errors',
        python_callable=log_errors
    )
    
    schema_validation >> business_rule_check >> log_errors_task
3.3.2. DAG Components
validate_schema(): Function to check schema correctness.
validate_business_rules(): Function to check business logic validation.
log_errors(): Logs errors into a centralized location and raises alerts if necessary.
4. Detailed Quality Check Implementation
4.1. Schema Validation

Ensure that the incoming data matches the defined schema.
Schema fields are loaded from configuration files, and any deviation triggers an error.
4.2. Null Value Checks

Identify any NULL values in non-nullable columns.
Implement this check using Spark's isNull() function.
python
Copy code
def null_value_check(dataframe, columns):
    for column in columns:
        if dataframe.filter(dataframe[column].isNull()).count() > 0:
            raise ValueError(f"Null values found in column {column}")
4.3. Business Rule Validation

Validate that business-specific rules are adhered to. Example: ensure that a product price is positive.
python
Copy code
def validate_price(dataframe):
    invalid_rows = dataframe.filter(dataframe['price'] < 0)
    if invalid_rows.count() > 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative prices found!")
4.4. Record Count Validation

Ensure that the record counts between source and staging match.
python
Copy code
def record_count_validation(source_count, staging_count):
    if source_count != staging_count:
        raise ValueError(f"Record count mismatch! Source: {source_count}, Staging: {staging_count}")
5. Monitoring and Logging
Centralized Logs: Store all logs in AWS CloudWatch or ELK Stack.
Failure Notifications: Implement Slack or email alerts for failed DQ checks using Airflow's notification system.
python
Copy code
from airflow.operators.email_operator import EmailOperator

alert_email = EmailOperator(
    task_id='send_failure_email',
    to='data_team@example.com',
    subject='Data Quality Check Failed',
    html_content="""<h3>Data Quality Check Failed</h3><p>Please review the logs for more details.</p>"""
)
6. Reporting
6.1. Data Quality Reports

Store reports on S3, accessible by authorized users via Ranger.
Include details such as rule ID, validation status, error count, and action taken.
6.2. Alert Dashboard

A real-time dashboard (e.g., using Grafana) to monitor data quality status and alerts.
Integration with a logging system (e.g., ELK Stack) to visualize the logs and validation errors.
7. Security and Access Control
7.1. Ranger Policies

Define access policies for who can view or modify data quality reports.
Role-based access controls (RBAC) for data engineers, data analysts, and other stakeholders.
7.2. Encryption

Data quality logs should be encrypted at rest in S3 using SSE.
Encrypt data during transit using TLS.
8. Resource Requirements
Apache Spark: Ensure enough cluster resources are available to process large datasets.
Airflow Scheduler: Ensure Airflow DAGs can run at regular intervals without bottlenecks.
S3 Storage: Adequate storage should be provisioned for logs and validation reports.
This detailed document should provide a clear roadmap for developers to start building the Data Quality and Validation Service for your modern data platform. The next steps would involve assigning roles, scheduling development tasks, and writing the corresponding tests for each feature.
